I am a Ph.D. student in the [Guangdong provincial Key Laboratory of Sapce-Aerial Networking & Intelligent Sensing](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/) at the University of Toronto, advised by Prof. [Zhang Tingting](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/zhangtingting/). 
My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and robotics, with a particular focus on sensor fusion data, deep representation learning, generative models and sensori-motor control in the context of autonomous systems.
<!-- Currently, I am exploring open-world 3D scene understanding algorithms that leverage the power of 2D foundation models. -->

I earned my Master's degree in Software Engineering from [Nankai University](https://csen.nankai.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Mengting Hu](https://hmt2014.github.io/homepage/). Before that, I received my Master's and Bachelor's degree from UPSI Malaysia, where I was lucky to work with Prof. [Aws Alaa Zaidan](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37547420400/)
